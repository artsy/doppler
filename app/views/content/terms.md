##2. Basic Terms

2.1 You may use the API only if you can form a binding contract with us, and only as permitted by law. You are not permitted to use the API if you are a person under the age of eighteen (18). If you are accepting these Terms and using the API on behalf of a company, organization, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to bind that entity to these Terms, in which case the terms “you” and “your” in these Terms will refer to that entity. 

2.2 Your use of the API is also subject to our general [Terms of Use](https://www.artsy.net/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.artsy.net/privacy) as amended by us from time to time. By accessing or using the Services in any manner, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. 

2.3 Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, worldwide (except as limited by these Terms), non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, revocable license to use the API in the manner permitted by these Terms. This license will terminate automatically if you breach any of these Terms. We may also terminate this license at any time for any reason, as provided in section 18 of these Terms. 

2.4 You agree to register for an Artsy account and to provide true and accurate information in doing so. After you register, we will provide you with an Application ID and a secret access code (each, “Your Key”) that you will use to access the API. You must not access the API without Your Key. You must not share Your Key with any third party or permit any third party to use Your Key. 

2.5 Your Key may only be used in connection with one (1) Application. If you wish to use the API in connection with more than one (1) Application, you must request an additional Key from us in each case, which may be granted or denied at our sole discretion.

2.6 You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your Key and your account password. You are responsible for all activities that occur under or through Your Key or your account or password. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect or become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of Your Key or your account or password, or other breach of security relating to the Services. You agree to immediately report to us any security flaws that you may discover in the Services. 

2.7 We may choose to provide you with support or modifications for the API (collectively “Support”). However, we have no obligation to do so, and we may terminate any and all Support, at any time at our sole discretion, without notice or liability. 

2.8 We are currently making the API available to you under these Terms free of charge. However, providing the API has real costs for us, including engineering work. We reserve the right to charge for future use of the API at our sole discretion.

2.9 You consent to receive communications from us electronically. You agree that we may communicate with you by email and/or by posting notices on the Services. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. 

2.10 You are responsible for providing any equipment, Internet, and telecommunication service necessary to use the API and/or to communicate with us at your own cost.

2.11 You represent and warrant that: (i) you have all necessary rights and authority to enter into these Terms and perform your obligations under these Terms; (ii) none of your performance under these Terms and no part of these Terms will violate any agreement or obligation that you have with or to any third party; and (iii) if you are a business, you are duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing in the country where you are registered.

3.2 You may access and use API Content only as permitted by the normal functionality and restrictions of the API, and only as permitted by any applicable Documentation.

3.7 API Content may contain copyright or trademark notices, or other proprietary notices indicating its source or ownership, and may be subject to third-party rights (for example, and without limitation, copyrights, trademark rights, privacy rights or publicity rights) and third-party conditions (for example, and without limitation, attribution requirements or additional licenses). You are solely responsible for determining and complying with all such applicable third-party rights and conditions that may apply to your use of any API Content in any manner or for any purpose. You will not remove, modify or conceal any such notices on the Services, in Your Application or elsewhere.

You will not store, use or disclose any User's non-public information.

3.10 Some Artwork Images, software, or other API Content may be offered under a third-party license (such as a Creative Commons license or an open source license) that we will notify and/or make available to you. Such license may be more permissive than some of these Terms, and/or may contain provisions that expressly override some of these Terms, in which case such license will control with respect to the use of such API Content (but not with respect to the use of any other API Content).

##4. Your Application 

4.1 In order for you to be able to use the API pursuant to these Terms, Your Application must be non-commercial. For example, you cannot: (i) charge any individual or entity a fee or otherwise ask or require them to pay to access or use Your Application (or any part thereof); or (ii) otherwise derive revenue through the operation, provision or use of Your Application (including but not limited to advertising or licensing revenue).
